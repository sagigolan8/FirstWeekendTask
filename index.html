            <p>Toilets are crucial for the healthy development of people, not to mention children. </p>

            <p>When we talk about toilet type, we mean the basic method that the toilet uses to flush and dispose of waste.</p>
            <p>From there, you will choose the best style and flushing technology that fits your overall design.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the three main toilet types: gravity-feed, pressure-assisted, double-cyclone, and waterless.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fast forward to today: around 60% of the world – 4.5 billion people – don't have a toilet that safely manages human waste at home.</li>
                <li>Would you show up if there were no toilets at your school? Globally, 1 in 3 schools do not have adequate toilets, and 23% of schools have no toilets at all.</li>
                <li>Schools without toilets can cause girls to miss out on their education. Without proper sanitation facilities, many are forced to miss school when they’re on their period.</li>
                <li>Toilets are a great investment. Every dollar spent on sanitation has a return of US$5.50, according to WHO research.</li>    
                <li>But still, 892 million people worldwide practise open defecation, meaning they go outside – on the side of the road, in bushes or rubbish heaps.</li>
                <li>Toilets save lives! Without toilets, deadly diseases spread rapidly. Over 750 children under five die every day from diarrhoea caused by unsafe water, sanitation, and poor hygiene.</li>
                <li>t’s time to make a stink! In order to get everyone in the world using toilets, we need to triple our current efforts. That doesn’t just mean more toilets, but creating the desire for people to use them.</li>
                <li>NASA invested more than $20 million in a suction-style toilet for the International Space Station.</li>
                <li>In 1890, the Scot Paper Company became the first manufacturer to use a roll for toilet paper.</li>

            <p>Toilet design is the main factor in determining why some toilets cost more than others.</p>
            <p> Generally speaking, one-piece, wall hung toilets tend to be more expensive than alternative styles.</p>
            <p> They incorporate a slick, sleeker appearance than their counterparts, and feature less crevices which makes them easier to clean.</p>

            <p>Two-piece, traditional toilets are the most common design available, and usually the most competitively priced in turn.</p>
